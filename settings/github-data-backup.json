The TCA reads in and uses vehicle trajectory information or Vissim output, roadside equipment (RSE) location information, cellular or event region information and strategy information to produce a series of snapshots that a connected vehicle would produce. Vehicles can be equipped to generate and transmit Probe Data Messages (PDMs), Basic Safety Messages (BSMs), Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) or ITS SPOT messages which can be transmitted by Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) and/or via cellular. The TCA program version 2 build 3 or 2.3 includes simulated communication disruptions between vehicles and roadside equipment. As soon as a vehicle equipped to transmit via DSRC is in range of a RSE, it will download all of its snapshot information directly with a probabilistic uncertainty of the data being lost. Similarly, if the vehicle is equipped to transmit via cellular, it will download all its snapshot information directly but those snapshots might be lost or delayed due to user-defined loss rate and latency. In TCA 2.3, BSMs and PDMs can also be made to transmit at user-defined intervals.",
